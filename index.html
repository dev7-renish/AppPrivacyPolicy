        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: <strong>December 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Thank you for using our mobile application. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we handle your information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable user data.</strong></p>

        <p>However, certain third-party services used in the app may collect non-personal, analytics-based information automatically.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services We Use</h2>
        <p>Our app integrates the following services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics for Firebase</strong> – Collects anonymized usage statistics (screen views, device type, performance events, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Services</strong> – Used only for analytics, crash reporting, and app stability. No personal information is collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – Displays ads. AdMob may use device identifiers for personalized/non-personalized ads as per Google’s policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Drive Backup</strong> – Users can voluntarily back up their app data to their own Google Drive account.  
                The app does not access, view, or store these files outside the user’s device and Google Drive.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All data collected by these services is handled according to Google's privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, we do not use or process any identifiable information.  
           Data collected by Google services is used only for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving app performance</li>
            <li>Fixing bugs and crashes</li>
            <li>Providing relevant ads (AdMob)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>All analytics and ad-related data are securely handled by Google’s systems.  
           No data is stored on our own servers.</p>

        <h2>5. Google Drive Backup Usage</h2>
        <p>The Google Drive backup feature is fully optional.  
           Your data is stored only in your personal Google Drive account and is never uploaded to our servers or shared with us.</p>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13.  
           We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in this page.</p>
